# INF601 - Advanced Programming in Python
# Alex (Danielle) Basden
# Final Project

### Purpose
Originally was going to be simple SquareSpace API get the login data and create form for the individuals to collect hours for Charity, ended up the President
did not give me the API.
Decided to create a website for them using Django, and yeah not the best time. 
But my creativity is shot from them.
Future will be to actually build them a website, that allows the user to track hours and then on a separate login page get total number of hours of charity work
The other thing is they will be able to buy tickets for charity their.
